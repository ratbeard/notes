spot reduction - reduce gut size through situps - is a myth.  Decrease overall body fat.
approach to fitness should be improve life habbits, not work out till 'in shape'

## diet 

Most important
All about calories in vs calories out.  Exercise determines what calories becomes (muscle or fat).

People over-consume saturated fats and trans fats, which raise your LDL ("bad") cholesterol and lower your HDL ("good") cholesterol, and under-consume healthy fats like monounsaturated fats (found in high concentrations in olive oil and canola oil) and Omega-3 fatty acids (found in fish, flax seed oil and other sources)

Omega3 fish oil is by far the best supplement
Whole eggs not unhealthy - most cholesterol is made by your liver, not direct from food
Veggi methods in health order - raw, steaming, baking, grilling, stir fry.
Hard to not improve your diet just by cooking your own food.
Beginners overestimate time and effort exercising.  Everyone underestimates calories eaten.
eating more meals doesn't speed up metabolism
starving is bad way to lose weight - metabolism slows down, lose muscle, feel bad.  be 500 calories under, losing 1 lb a week

Lifting burns tons of calories, and lifting weights while dieting will cause you to retain more muscle and lose more fat than just diet and/or cardio.

My suggestion is to alternate weights and cardio, for instance doing 3 days of weights, 2 days of cardio, and taking the other 2 days off. Doing both on the same day tends to cause one or the other to suffer from reduced effort, and generally burns people out.

## Cardio

up to 30 minutes at a time.  Increase intensity as you get better.  start with a warm up.

## weights

compound (2 or more joints) are better than single, especially for beginners
good programs work out the entire body
go heavy - using enough weight that you can only do 5-10 repetitions of a compound lift before needing a rest
Machine exercises are inferior to using free weights in almost every situation
track progress - Write down how much you lifted & how many times you lifted it every session!
Only do the exercise for as long as you can do the exercise properly and control the weight. If you can't control the weight, reduce the weight until you can
warm up - A few minutes of light cardio is a good general warm-up. Then before you do each exercise, do 8-12 reps with very light weight.
Be conservative at first, but from then on constantly try to add weight or increase the number of repetitions for every exercise from workout to workout. If you do this, you'll be working very hard soon enough. 2.5% more weight per week is a realistic goal, and at first you may gain more like 5%/week.
