Gulf of Execution:
    Intentions - Allowable actions.  How complex is the process?
    
Gulf of Evaluation:
    Effort to interpret state of system and determine if intentions have been met.  How intuitive is it?
    
       ↗   Goals  ⤵
Interpret       Execution
       ↖   World  ⤶ 

Conceptual Models: 
    User::Model.should == Design::Model :through => SystemImage

visibility:
    don't hide controls

Affordances: 
    perceived props of object determine how it can be used.  esp. in physical design e.g. buttons, chair

Mappings: 
   determine relations between controller and controlled??  Use physical and cultural constraints
   
Constraints: 
    limit range of possible actions.
    
    - physical ◊ one way to put invhs tape 
    - semantic ◊ rearview mirrors only make sense in one direction
    - cultural ◊ red/green lights
    - logical  ◊ 4 things, 4 controls
    
Feedback: 
    people build models in head.  All actions should have effects.
    
Put Knowledge in the World:
    reduce memory strain.  ◊ toolbars.  head vs world
    
Error:
    slip: error in automatic actions.  easy to find
    mistake: error in intention or logic.  hard to find
    support undo.
    limit later actions when error occurs
    
Standardization:
    last resort since cultural dependent & arbitrary.  Quicker to learn
    
## User-Centered Design

Based on real people and their abilities, context, and tasks trying to accomplish.  Design evolves and adapts.  Close collaboration.  

Phases:

1. Identify: and define problem
2. Design:  Select tasks to support and create mockups/prototypes
3. Evaluations:  Test with users.

Task: 
    What you want to do
Scenario:
    How to accomplish task in an interface, in detail
    
Users:
    
    - Novice: little knowledge task or interface.  (Step by step…)
    - First time: know task, not interface         (… feedback critical)
    - Knowledgable but infrequent: know task, interface concepts, not details (recog vs recall)
    - Experts: speed, macros, brief feedback
    
Ethnography:
    Immerse in user's environment, participate in day to day activites.  Using results for design can be hard.

Contextual Design:
    User is expert, designer is apprentice.  Visit 2-3 hours a day.
    
Work models:
    Consolidate models and form big picture from data gathered.
