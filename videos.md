# Rich Hickey - Design Composition Performance

http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Design-Composition-Performance?utm_source=infoq&utm_medium=videos_homepage&utm_campaign=videos_row2

Design - take things apart in a way that you can put them back together.

Take apart requirements
  move from want to need
  synmptons/root causes

Take apart flow
  queues
  idempotency
  commutation - new big huge thing
  transactions

Take apart mechanism/information
  OO - munge platonic idea and implementation ??

Take apart solutions
  libraries - all about benefits, not tradeoffs

Reuse comes from breaking apart in a way that can easily be put back together
Top level tests - best kind
Bartok - good hungarian composer, coltrane - best improv, my favorite things

Art design impose restriction on self, design solution.  Largest design (orchestra) spelled out in much more detail than small projects (song - melody) - opposite of software
harmonic sensibility is a critical design skill
Gets a little slow talking about music history
Base unit - instruments - are simple, do 1 thing.  Hard if base unit is complex (nested circuit-keyboard instruments)
Programmers think we can just show up w/o practicing
Wrong with sql - designed human interface, not machine (disgusting to try and build on top)
No specialization in software - code at every level
The paralysis of choice - constraint is a driver of creativity
Key thing - problems, constraints, be optimistic.  AND make decision
Leaving everything open, configurable - not helpful to next guy
Practice


# Joe Armstrong - Systems that never stop

http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Systems-that-Never-Stop-Joe-Armstrong

6 properties of systems that never stop
key idea - limit propagation of failure
checkout - jim gray, why do computers stop and what can be done about it.
halt on failure - let supervisor handle, don't make things worse.
OOP not about encapsulating state or inheritance - about (pure) messaging and polymorphism.



# Peter Thiel and Andy Kessler on the state of technology and innovation 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jX07zPupNdc

Debate on is the rate of technological progress slowing down.  Some areas have large innovation rate, most have not improved much in the last 40 years.  Median income
not raised much.  A robot that can fold laundry is still very far away.  

Regulation is a huge problem, in energy, biotech.
